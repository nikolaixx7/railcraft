Huge compilation of 1.7.10 mods including Railcraft!

How to install?

just click the deploy starter, if you have JAVA version it will automatically install the mods to the game's dirs. If you have bedrock you must manually move all the folders and subfolders
for the sake of not crashing, i suggest getting the JAVA version.

You can add extra mods to the /dev/bin folder if you want, the starter will also get them in place for you.
